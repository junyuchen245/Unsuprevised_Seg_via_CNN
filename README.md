This is a Tensorflow/Keras implementation of my paper:

*** Note that this method does ***binary*** segmentation. Please check out our new approach (<a href="https://github.com/junyuchen245/Semi-supervised_FCM_Loss_for_Segmentation">***FCM loss***</a>) for unsupervised and semi-supervised loss functions for multi-class segmentation (PyTorch and TensorFlow).</span>

## Evaluation and Results:
We evaluated four settings of the proposed algorithm on the task of bone segmentation in bone SPECT images:

* Mode 1: Unsupervised (self-supervised) training with L_ACWE.

* Mode 2: Mode 1 + fine-tuning using L_label with 10 ground truth (GT) labels.

* Mode 3: Mode 1 + fine-tuning using L_label with 80 GT labels.

* Mode 4: Training with L_ACWE + L_label.

The quantitative results can be found in the paper, and here are some qualitative results:
